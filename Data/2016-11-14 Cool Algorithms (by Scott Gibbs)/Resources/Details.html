Computers solve seemingly impossible problems everyday.<br>
They appear intelligent, yet are just simple machines.<br>
How do they do this?<br>
What makes them smart?<br>
This XTalk looks at two fascinating and useful algorithms that play a part in simulating intelligent behaviour.<br>
<br>
Come see how evolution can play an important part in modern life,<br>
and learn how robots can navigate complex systems autonomously.<br>
<br>
If you survived high school science then you'll find these concepts surprisingly simple, yet incredibly powerful.<br>
There's even demos of these algorithms in action!<br>
So come on by and discover the beauty behind computer intelligence.
