<br>
An easy book to read that will simply make your life better, no matter who you are.<br>
<br>
The authors of this book claim 9 times out of 10 you can achieve results by having a crucial conversation. Any results. Project results at work. Happy relationship results. They back this claim up by demonstrating 7 principles of a Crucial Conversation.<br>
<br>
In this speech I hope to demonstrate the inspiration this book has given me. Put simply, my life is significantly easier having read the book.<br>
<br>
To help demonstrate this I review the 7 main principle using a mindmap. I then cover an example straight from the book, and finally I demonstrate a "state engine" I built which tracks conversations and highlights the principles you should be following.
