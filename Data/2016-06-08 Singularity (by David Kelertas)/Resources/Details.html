What is the singularity?
<br>
When will it occur?
<br>
What will it mean to humans?
<br>
Technological unemployment has been happening for centuries, are we now nearing an endpoint to human employment?
<br>
What will we do without employment income?
<br>
Join me for an introduction to these topics and some differing opinions and strategies people around the world are working on right now.
