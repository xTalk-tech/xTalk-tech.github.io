C# Deep-dive: What does your code actually become?<br>
A look into what your lambdas and function become under the hood, from IL to Assembly and what that means for performance.<br>
This talk should be approachable enough for all experiences - including novices, while still providing enough technical grit to keep even the hardest developer interested.
