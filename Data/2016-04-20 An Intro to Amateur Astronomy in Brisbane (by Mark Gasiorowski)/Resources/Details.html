<br>
Want to find out a bit more about doing amateur astronomy in Brisbane, what's involved, and people who can help?<br>
<br>
What are some of the best viewing spots, and how far do you really need to go to see something?<br>
<br>
What are the different types of telescopes?  Why are there so many?  Which one is best, and how much do they cost?<br>

<br>
What clubs are there around Brisbane where you can get help?<br>
<br>
I'll touch on astrophotography - although that's a true rabbit hole!<br>
<br>
I'm a member of two astronomy clubs in Brisbane, do regular presentations there, and helped run Qld Astrofest, so can help with any questions you might have.<br>
<br>
And .. I'll be bringing along a serious amateur telescope (or two) for you to have a look at, and see how they work up close.<br>
<br>
Come along and learn a bit about one of the most fantastic hobbies for you and your family!<br>
<br>
See you there!<br>
