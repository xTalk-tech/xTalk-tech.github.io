"Do not try and bend the spoon.
<br>
That's impossible.
<br>
Instead only try to realize the truth.
<br>
<b>There is no spoon.</b>
<br>
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself."
<br>
<br>
<br>
Quantum Physics is a place where Philosophy meets Science.
<br>
And Quantum Entanglement is one way of <b>proving</b> that we all live inside some kind of matrix!
<br>
<br>
Quantum Physics is a very relevant aspect of our every day life.
<br>
It's what makes transistors work inside every TV, watch, phone and computer.
<br>
It's also what makes every atom inside of you work as well!
<br>
BUT the Universe is not what you think it is.
<br>
It's more amazing than anything that you could imagine...and it's REAL!
<br>
Come and see some Quantum Physics experiments that will prove how strange the world around us is!
