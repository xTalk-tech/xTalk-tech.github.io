<b>Stars:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;the physical building blocks of the universe.<br>
How do they work?  Where do they come from?<br>
What's going on inside them?  What types are there?<br>
Where do they end up?<br>
Why are there no green stars?<br>
Come along to the October xTalk to learn about how they're made, how they work,<br>
and why you're made of them!
